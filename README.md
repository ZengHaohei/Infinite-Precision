It shall not be used for any terrorist activities, military purposes, or any technology that harms the world, nations, individuals, the environment, animals, etc., or results in such consequences. The article and its extended content must not be used for any direct or indirect commercial activities. Corporations are prohibited from using it, and I reserve the right to invalidate any related patents and "fences" built based on this article.

Before sending me a lawyer's letter or initiating legal action, please first incorporate the involved physical constants, universal laws, and professional terms into corporate or personal ownership, and clearly mark that others are not allowed to use them. Furthermore, provide evidence that is globally recognized and accepted by all countries and personnel using this article and its extended technology.

I do not know how people might exploit loopholes to bypass these regulations, but even if you do, your patents, papers, and other carriers must prominently cite the link to this article and include my name. However, even if you do so, I reserve the right to withdraw your publication involving this article and its extended content at any time. By basing your work on, extending, or citing this article, it means you agree to all the terms and interpretations of rights in this entire article.

Now, let us begin.

**For Skeptics: Hypothetical Proof of Principle:**
Assume there is the world's fastest and most stable rail train validating the feasibility of its rigidity and stability; assume chips are made of glass, thus glass validates the feasibility of its control and precision; assume black-and-white human photographs from a black-and-white camera seem to validate the feasibility of its magnetic field adjustment method. These principle hypotheses are personal conjectures; readers should verify them independently online, and they are unrelated to me.

**And for Experts:**

* **Applied Physics/Electromagnetics:** Field synthesis of multi-magnet arrays, magnetic shielding, and shaping principles. "A programmable passive magnetic potential well topology technology is implemented, using perturbation units for local linear correction of the background field."
* **Control Theory:** Physical structures replace software algorithms, achieving "hardware closed-loop control." "This system is essentially a feedforward-feedback composite controller based on analog computation. The metal sheet array is a solidified, adjustable 'control law matrix' that directly compensates for errors in real-time through physical means."
* **Precision Mechanical Engineering:** Realization of motion precision is completely detached from traditional Abbe error chains and rigidity constraint principles. "We propose a new paradigm of 'mechanical base error isolation,' decoupling guidance precision from the macro-morphology of the base, significantly reducing the strict requirements for basic mechanical processing."
* **Materials Science:** Precise utilization of magnetic permeability, thickness, and shape of metal sheets as tuning units. "We developed a method using soft magnetic material microstructure units as field-tuning operators to achieve precision shaping of the magnetic field distribution."

Finally, if you still have doubts, please spend a few dozen yuan to replicate the experimental content and then use the experimental results to counter. "Practice is the sole criterion for testing truth."

To simplify understanding for the general public: Please imagine the base magnetic field as the water surface, the moving part as a boat, the unit error size as the size of the water ripples, the number of units covered by the moving part as the size of the boat, and the tuning body as a board that can press down and divert the water.

# "Error Acceptance: A New Paradigm of High-Robustness Precision Motion Based on Passive Field Computation"

As long as physical constants remain unchanged, this experiment verifies that going from 0 to 1 proves that from 1 to 100 is a wide highway in principle. Subsequent engineering obstacles are conventional challenges within the known physical scope, rather than fundamental "impossibilities."

My contribution lies in **"Discovering the path,"** while everyone else needs to **"Make the road wider and flatter."**

### Abstract:

This paper first proposes and experimentally verifies the statistical averaging paradigm in precision motion. Experiments show that through discrete tuning of passive magnetic fields, system errors decrease at a scaling rate of  as the number of tuning units  increases. This proves that through passive magnetic field shaping and statistical averaging principles, a motion system can be constructed whose theoretical precision is only limited by manufacturing limits and is independent of the macro-morphology of the base, thereby achieving the decoupling of motion precision from macro-mechanical base errors in principle.

Traditional precision paradigms are deterministic error chains; my new paradigm is statistical error averaging. The former's cost grows exponentially with precision, while the latter's cost (theoretically) grows linearly. This points to a brand-new physical path for achieving nanometer-level precision on low-cost bases.

**Core Proof:** This experiment proves that through this paradigm, macro-roughness (3mm) can be suppressed by more than two orders of magnitude (to 0.3mm) even in extreme environments. This crosses the paradigm boundary from "mechanical contact determining precision" to "field statistics determining precision."

**Logical Leap (Critical):** Since this paradigm does not rely on any nonlinear or saturation effects, there is a clear, predictable scaling relationship between precision improvement and the number of tuning units covered by the moving part (e.g., residual error ). Therefore, in principle, as long as manufacturability allows, increasing the number of units can improve precision to the nanometer level; there are no fundamental obstacles. Furthermore, as the gain brought by increasing the quantity gradually decreases, other methods are introduced in combination.

### Introduction:

Existing active field control schemes rely on complex closed loops. We explore whether similar statistical averaging effects can be achieved through passive, discrete 'hardware-programmed' field structures, thereby significantly reducing system complexity.

The overall performance of this system is dominated by the number of units . According to the Central Limit Theorem, the output force of  independent and identically distributed tuning units has a residual error (uncertainty) that theoretically converges at a rate of .

### Experimental Data and Results:

* **Experimental Materials:** Two wooden sticks (chopsticks), 1mm thickness nano-tape, 502 super glue, hard smooth plastic sheets, toothpicks, cotton string, 10*2mm round NdFeB magnets, 50*20*2mm rectangular NdFeB magnets.
* **Total Cost:** 35 CNY (5 USD).
* **Approximate Installation Method:** Apply nano-tape to the wooden sticks, then place magnets. Round magnets are spaced at about 5mm. Separate the rectangular magnets slightly and bond them with toothpicks and glue, then press them vertically onto the nano-tape with only one side peeled, or peel the other side and attach a plastic sheet. Tie cotton string to the top, and use the repulsive force of the two wooden sticks to squeeze the rectangular magnets in the middle. (Note: During installation, ensure both sticks are repellent to the rectangular magnets.)

This experiment verifies whether the system itself can continue to be realized under many almost unforgivable errors and validates its extraordinary robustness. The experimental conditions are as follows:

* **Wooden sticks (chopsticks) chosen as the installation base:** Surface roughness is that of normal wooden sticks; the stick itself is larger at one end and smaller at the other, with about 2mm plane error; it is in a bent state, with a circular arc shape protruding downward at the center point with a maximum of about 3mm from end to end; the other stick is similar, the two sticks themselves are not parallel or aligned, and the spacing between them is large-small-large; the sticks themselves are not fixed, or only a small area of 1mm thickness nano-tape is used to fix them on a cup to prevent collapse.
* **Units used are ordinary NdFeB magnets purchased from the market:** Their manufacturing error is greater than 15%; 10*2mm specification round magnets are installed randomly at a distance of about 0~3mm from the center line of the wooden stick via 1mm thickness nano-tape with random force. The nano-tape itself is soft and deforms under force, leading to deformation errors due to manual installation; randomly sized paper balls are manually crumpled as shims to raise one side of the round magnets, creating random height and parallel differences in random angles and directions.
* **Toothpicks used to form the connecting moving part:** The moving part composed of two 50*20*2mm specification rectangular magnets is bonded with toothpicks and glue. Toothpicks are obviously not a common connecting part; due to manual installation, the X, Y, and Z axes of the two magnets are not parallel; nano-tape is applied to the plastic sheet, and the connected magnets are pressed into the nano-tape to maintain stability; the actual installation is not perpendicular to the surface, twisted to an angle of about 60~70 degrees due to the magnetic field on both sides.
* **Manual pulling of string used as the feed method:** Due to manual error, the force, direction, distance, and speed are inconsistent during each repetition.
* **Pencil lead installed near the center of the moving part to draw curves:** The pencil lead is directly inserted into the hole, is not completely fixed and will swing slightly, and the length protruding from the bottom is manually controlled.
* **0.1mm thickness 430 stainless steel sheet used as the primary adjustment method:** Manually cut, overall shape is approximately a 1:2 rectangle, surface area is about 2c㎡ ; adjustment method: place in high magnetic field areas based on visual observation and feeling.

So, under such conditions, what can we get? Below are the results:

According to the results shown in the figures:
Each curve was repeated about 5 times and perfectly overlapped as observed by the naked eye, so the experimental results are not a single special case.

* **The 1st curve shows:** Increasing the number of units covered by the moving part can achieve high precision on a low-precision basis under harsh conditions; a curve with an average error of about 1mm was drawn on the basis of various comprehensive errors greater than 3mm.
* **The 2nd curve shows:** Removing the shims and the errors they bring can improve precision. The errors brought by shims are magnetic field height, angle, direction, and parallel errors, and these errors themselves are greater than the magnet manufacturing error of 15%. This not only proves that manufacturing errors can be filtered but also that precision can be improved by manually adjusting these parameters; a curve with an average error of about 0.3mm was drawn after reducing shim errors.
* **The 3rd curve shows:** Based on the 1st curve, using tuning sheets for magnetic field adjustment can improve precision; using twelve 0.1mm thickness 430 stainless steel thin sheets with a single area of about 2c㎡  adjusted the curve with an average error of about 1mm to an average error of about 0.5mm. One tuning sheet is approximately equal to 0.05mm adjustment precision.
* **The 4th curve shows:** After removing the tuning sheets, the precision returns to the 1st curve; the random distance and placement between the bases each time does not affect the overall result. As long as there is a certain repulsive force from the magnetic fields on the left and right sides, the moving part will automatically return to the center, and the forward direction is determined by the virtual centerline composed of the magnetic fields on both sides.

**Is this the limit of manual work? Why not continue?**
This is not the limit. In this experiment, 2 rectangular magnets only covered the magnetic field of about 20 round magnets. What if 4 rectangular magnets were used to cover 40 round magnets? What if we continue to increase them? Of course, reaching a certain quantity will lead to a serious decline in returns, but the basic returns are already beyond imagination.

Furthermore, I have tuning sheets. With a single 0.1mm thickness tuning sheet of 2c㎡  area based on 20 sampling points, its adjustment precision has already reached 0.05mm. What would the adjustment precision be if the area were reduced 100 times to 2m㎡ ? What would the adjustment precision be if the sampling points were increased to 200?

Yes, the above is just the manual limit under harsh conditions. What would happen in a less harsh environment, using better materials for assembly, standard installation methods, and using algorithms to derive the shape, volume, and area of tuning sheets after simulating the magnetic field with a computer?

**Why not continue?** Under these materials and extreme environments, the simplest version has already touched my measurement limit of 0.1mm (ruler), so I cannot continue. I have verified the principle and planned the subsequent route.

### Conclusion and Outlook:

This study provides an experimental foundation for a brand-new precision motion design paradigm. Combining discrete passive field averaging principles with advanced manufacturing is expected to catalyze revolutionary low-cost, high-precision equipment in semiconductor, optical, and extreme space environments.

It breaks the tradition of high-precision processing for low precision. Simply increasing the number of units covered by the moving part can exponentially improve precision. However, the purpose of increasing the quantity is to enhance the length averaging effect. After adopting different structures, averages in directions like up-down, left-right, rotation, and roll—which have the same principle but different directions—bring exponential improvements again. The resulting spatial average is a multiplication operation for the original formula. The precision improvement effect brought by adjusting the magnetic field is itself a calculation factor for the above two methods.

Therefore, with three complementary exponential improvements, the theoretical precision itself is infinite. After the multiplication of three infinite precision methods, it can achieve infinite precision with an unparalleled cost advantage and a convenient method that can be manufactured almost casually.

So, how do we move forward on the path ahead? Don't worry, I have already drawn the route directly to the finish line.

**First, start from the base:**

* **Simple method:** Sand the wood flat and then polish it, then perform straightness calibration. This improves magnetic field flatness on the reference surface.
* **Harder:** If you really don't like wood, replace it with granite or some other stone. (How could anyone not love wood? It's made of high-performance low-pass damping filtering carbon fiber material!)
* **Even harder:** Use plastic or some other metal, but magnetic metals will deform the magnetic field, requiring computer simulation or other means of isolation.

**Then, start from the magnetic source:**

* **Simple method:** Purchase or customize magnets with a manufacturing error of less than 5%, and select magnets with an error of less than 1% from multiple magnets through a matching method. This increases magnetic field flatness from the manufacturing source.
* **Harder:** After the above methods, use demagnetization methods like pulsing or heating to manually or automatically calibrate local or all magnetic fields to make them flatter.
* **Even harder:** Optimize from the source of magnetic field manufacturing, or refer to some existing solutions, such as using electromagnets or superconductors, though most of them require algorithms, software, and hardware and are quite expensive before mass production.

**Then, start from the installation method:**

* **Simple method:** Use hard or soft glue, draw lines on the base after a certain arrangement, and then stick the sources directly onto the base. After the above methods, there is already a relatively flat reference surface, so don't worry about errors; physics and mathematics will forgive you.
* **Harder:** Choose more suitable connection methods or glues, use tweezers or other means to ensure installation precision after a designed arrangement, and use ordinary shims under the magnetic sources for micro-adjustments to ensure overall parallelism.
* **Even harder:** Screen for the most suitable connection method, simulate with a computer or find the existing optimal arrangement plan, automate to improve installation precision, and use complex means for installation tuning.

**Then, the moving part:**

* **Simple method:** Use plastic sheets or something else to keep the slider stable.
* **Harder:** Use some kind of passive circuit found online to keep the slider relatively stable in one position.
* **Even harder:** Directly switch to superconductors, or use precision control and algorithms plus electromagnets or other methods to keep the slider stable.

**Finally, the tuning body:**

* **Simple:** Purchase pre-cut tuning sheets of 0.5  or your preferred size, then simply measure the magnetic force or infer the area needing adjustment from the results, and place them for adjustment. They can also be permanently fixed with glue or something else. After a series of processes from reference surface to manufacturing to installation, the magnetic field itself is already very flat, and micro-adjustments at this time can make it even flatter.
* **Harder:** For the 1st layer, it is recommended to use a thickness of 0.2mm or more. Use a custom 36-zone tuning sheet divided by a cross grid, dividing a round magnet into 36 equal square or other shaped open areas. If conditions permit, perform measurements and close off areas with stronger magnetic fields; if not, install directly. The 2nd layer uses a grid tuning sheet with larger diameter orderly or disorderly arranged circular or square holes. The 3rd layer uses a grid tuning sheet with smaller diameter orderly or disorderly arranged circular or square holes. It is recommended that the thickness decreases layer by layer.
* **Even harder:** Use custom tuning sheets after computer simulation, or directly use a tuning body, for example, placing it to perfectly adjust the magnetic field into a hyperplane, or simply increase the number of layers to break the magnetic field into a "fluid" layer by layer.

Is that all? No, the most exciting part has just begun!

**Adjustable part structures:**

* **A classic structure:** Assume the base uses a rectangular wood with a width-to-height ratio of 2:1. Then use a shorter and larger rectangular wood with a rectangular hole dug through the middle so it can fit over the four sides of the base with a gap of about 4mm to act as a slider. On the upper surface of the base, place two rows of magnets symmetrically on the left and right; same for the lower surface. Place a row of magnets on the centerline of the left surface; same for the right surface. Then dig out gaps in the slider or leave only a hollow structure for support to place rectangular magnets. A total of 6 rows of rectangular magnets correspond to six rows of round magnets.
* **Pseudo-pinning effect:** This structural characteristic, after adding physical support or software control, limits the slider's degrees of freedom in up-down, left-right, rotation, and roll, which is extremely similar to the pinning effect of superconductors. However, due to another effect of superconductors, it can move back and forth on the magnetic field surface, thus effectively achieving basically the same function.

**Assembled part modules:**

* **Precision enhancement assembly:** Treat the above classic structure as a module. Place two modules in parallel and connect their respective sliders to continue increasing the quantity to improve precision. Due to previous principle verification, the precision of two modules is higher than that of one, and the number can continue to be increased until a certain limit of returns is reached.
* **Large-range movement assembly:** Connect two modules according to the precision enhancement assembly as the X-axis. Then place the two ends of the base on two other modules perpendicular to these two modules as the Y-axis. Finally, add miniaturized modules on the X-axis as the Z-axis in this way. Due to previous principle verification, this architecture maximizes the use of spatial averaging of all constituent architectures to significantly improve precision performance, making the Z-axis of the center point enter the "zero point" of the entire architecture.
* **Small-range movement ultra-precision assembly:** Connect modules in a 3x3 dot matrix, using 8 modules to filter errors so that the precision of the middle module achieves a qualitative leap.

**Adjustable part modes:**

* **Full passive:** Use physical support on the slider surface to keep it stable, or connect another module on the left, right, or both sides. The connected module is linked to fixed objects, moving objects, etc. During power transmission, it is somewhat limited by the fixed objects, but since fixed objects only support roll and rotation degrees of freedom, the influence is less than 20%. More than 80% relies on the magnetic field and structural self-stability. Since the module itself is a filter, after being filtered by one module, it can be filtered again at the center module to minimize the impact. This mode itself requires external force to move.
* **Semi-passive:** Use certain circuit characteristics related to electromagnets to maintain stable levitation of the slider without the need for algorithms. This mode itself is static; control devices can be added to manually adjust the thrust.
* **Semi-active:** Use something to actively provide and control thrust.
* **Full-active:** Use some way to actively increase and control thrust, and use some way to make the slider more stable and improve precision again.
* **Phase shift:** Fix the slider and let the base act as the moving part.

**Finally: More is better, big is strong!**
Although a single module might reach infinite precision, it would require a very high price. Therefore, a structure that is itself a filter should be used to infinitely reduce this price.

《误差接纳：一种基于被动场计算的高鲁棒性精密运动新范式》

只要物理常数不变，本实验验证了从0到1，就证明了从1到100在原理上是一条康庄大道，后续的工程障碍是已知物理范畴内的常规挑战，而非原理性的“不可能”。

我的贡献在于 “发现了那条路” ，而大家需要做的是 “把路铺得更宽更平” 。

摘要:

本文首次提出并实验验证了精密运动中的统计平均范式。实验表明，通过被动磁场的离散调谐，系统误差随调谐单元数量 N 的增加而按 1/√N 的标度率降低，证明了通过被动磁场整形与统计平均原理，可以构建一种其理论精度仅受制于制造极限，而与基座宏观形貌无关的运动系统，从而在原理上实现了运动精度与机械基座宏观误差的解耦。

传统精密范式是确定性误差链；我的新范式是统计性误差平均。前者成本随精度指数增长，后者成本（理论上）线性增长。这为在低成本基座上实现纳米级精度，指明了一条全新的物理路径。

核心证明：本实验证明，通过该范式，在极端环境下也可以将宏观粗糙度（3mm）抑制两个数量级以上（至0.3mm）。这跨越了从“机械接触决定精度”到“场统计决定精度”的范式边界。

逻辑飞跃（关键）：由于该范式不依赖任何非线性或饱和效应，其精度提升与运动部件所覆盖调谐单元的数量之间存在明确、可预测的标度关系（例如，残余误差 ∝ 1/√N）。因此，在原理上，只要可制造性允许，通过增加单元数量即可将精度提升至纳米级，不存在原理性障碍。并由于增加数量带来的增益逐渐降低，固引入其他方法相结合。

引言:

现有主动场控制方案依赖于复杂闭环，我们探讨能否通过被动、离散的‘硬件编程’场结构，实现类似的统计平均效果，从而大幅降低系统复杂性

本系统整体性能由单元数量N主导。根据中心极限定理，N个独立同分布调谐单元的输出合力，其不确定性（即残余误差）理论上以1/√N的速率收敛。

实验数据与结果:

实验材料:两根木棍（筷子）、1mm厚度纳米胶带、502胶水、较硬的光滑塑料薄片、牙签、棉绳、10*2mm圆形钕磁铁、50*20*2mm长方形钕磁铁

实验总花费:35CNY（5USD）

大致安装方式:木棍上贴上纳米胶，然后放上磁铁，圆形磁铁间距约5mm，将长方形磁铁中间隔开一些用牙签与胶水粘接，然后垂直按入只撕开一边的纳米胶上，或者说撕开另一边贴上塑料片，顶端粘上棉绳，然后两根木棍用斥力将长方形磁铁挤在中间。（注意，安装过程中要确定两根棍子都与长方形磁铁是相斥的）

本次实验验证了在许多几乎不可饶恕的错误之下，系统本身能否继续实现，并验证了其非凡的鲁棒性，实验条件为以下:

选用两根木棍（筷子）作为安装基座:表面粗糙度为正常木棍；木棍本身一头大一头小，约2mm平面误差；其本身为弯曲状态，中心点向下凹出从头到尾其最大点约3mm的圆弧形；另一根木棍情况相似，两根木棍本身不平行对齐，并且之间间距为大-小-大；木棍本身不固定，或者仅小面积使用1mm厚度纳米胶带固定在杯子上防止倒塌；

选用单元采用市场上购买的普通钕磁铁作为单元:其本身制造误差约大于15%；10*2mm规格圆形磁铁通过1mm厚度纳米胶带随机间距与力度的安装在木棍离中心线距离约0~3mm的位置，其纳米胶带本身是软的会受力变形，并且由于手工安装导致形变误差；人为揉搓随机大小的纸团作为垫片将圆形磁铁一边垫高，产生了随机角度、随机方向的随机高度差与平行差；

使用牙签组成连接运动部件:两个50*20*2mm规格长磁铁组成的运动部件本身由牙签与胶水进行粘接，牙签显然不是一个常用的连接件；由于手工安装，两个磁铁本身XYZ轴并不平行；在塑料片上粘上纳米胶带，然后将连接好的磁铁按入纳米胶内来保持稳定；实际安装后并非垂直于表面，因两边磁场作用扭曲为约60~70度角；

使用手工拉线作为进给方式:由于手工误差，其每次重复时力量、方向、距离、速度等并不一致；

在运动部件较为中心位置打孔安装铅笔芯以绘制曲线:铅笔芯是直接插入孔中的，本身并不完全固定会一定摆动，底部伸出长度由手工控制；

使用0.1mm厚度430不锈钢片作为初级调整方式:手工裁剪，总体形状约为1:2长方形，表面积约为2c㎡；调整方式为，凭肉眼观察与感觉往磁场高的区域放置；

那么，在这样的条件下我们能得到什么？以下是图片与结果:

每根曲线绘制都重复了约5次，通过肉眼观察是完美重叠，所以实验结果并非单次特例。

第1根曲线表明了:增加运动部件所覆盖单元数量可以在恶劣条件下的低精度基础上实现高精度；在大于3mm的各种综合误差基础上画出了平均误差约1mm的曲线。

第2根曲线表明了:通过去除垫片以及其所带来的误差可以让精度提升，垫片带来的误差是磁场高度、角度、方向、平行误差，且这些误差本身大于磁铁制造误差15%，所以不仅证明了可以过滤制造误差还可以通过人为调整这些参数来提高精度；在减少垫片误差之后画出了平均误差约0.3mm的曲线。

第3根曲线表明了:在第1根曲线的基础上通过使用调谐片进行磁场调节可以让精度提升；使用12片0.1mm厚度单个面积约2c㎡的430不锈钢薄片将平均误差约1mm的曲线调整为平均误差约0.5mm，一个调谐片约等于0.05mm调节精度。

第4根曲线表明了:去除调谐片之后，精度还原为第1根曲线；每次基座之间的随机距离与摆放并不影响整体结果，只要在左右两边磁场的一定斥力之下，运动部件就会自动回归中心，并且前进方向由左右两边磁场组成的虚拟中心线决定。

这是手工极限吗，为什么不继续？

这不是极限，这个实验2个长方形磁铁只覆盖了约20个圆形磁铁的磁场，那么使用4个长方形磁铁覆盖40个圆形磁铁呢？再继续增加呢？当然到达一定数量导致收益严重下降，但基本收益已经超出想象。

但是我还有调谐片，单个0.1mm厚度面积2c㎡的调谐片在20个采样点的基础上，它的调整精度就已经达到0.05mm，那么缩小100倍面积使用2m㎡调谐片它的调整精度是多少？将采样点提升至200它的调整精度会是多少？

是的，上面只是恶劣情况下的手工极限而已，在一个不那么恶劣的环境，使用较好的材料组装，使用标准的方式安装，在使用计算机来模拟磁场之后使用算法得出调谐片形状、体积、面积来进行调节，那么会发生什么？

为什么不继续？在这种材料与极限环境之下使用最简陋的版本就已经触碰我的测量极限0.1mm（直尺），所以无法继续，并且我已经验证了原理并规划好了后续路线。

结论与展望:

本研究为一个全新的精密运动设计范式提供了实验基石。将离散被动场平均原理与先进制造相结合，有望在半导体、光学及太空极端环境下催生革命性的低成本高精度设备。

其打破了传统高精度加工低精度的传统，单独增加运动部件覆盖单元数量就已经可以指数级提升精度，但是增加数量的目的是为了提升长度平均效应，而采用不同结构之后引入了上下、左右、旋转、翻滚等原理相同但方向不同的平均再次带来指数级提升，其混合而出的空间平均对于原式为乘法运算，通过调整磁场带来精度提升效应本身就是上方两个方法的计算因子。

所以，三个相辅相成的指数级提升，其理论精度本身就是无限，三个无限精度的方法乘法运算之后，它可以用无与伦比的的成本优势与几乎随手就能制造出的便捷方法，来达到无限精度。

那么，之后的道路怎么前进呢？不要慌，我已经画好了直达终点的路线。

首先从基座开始:

简单的方法:将木头磨平然后抛光，再进行直线度校准，这是在基准面上提高磁场平整度。

困难一点:如果你真的不喜欢木头，那么就把它换成花岗岩或者其他什么石头。（怎么会有人不爱木头呢？那可是由高性能低通阻尼滤波碳纤维材质组成的）

再困难一点:使用塑料或者其他什么金属，但是导磁的金属会让磁场变形，这就需要计算机模拟计算，或者其他手段进行隔离。

然后从磁源开始:

简单的方法:购买或者定制制造误差小于5%的磁铁，通过选配法在多个磁铁中分组选出误差小于1%的磁铁，这从制造根本上增加了磁场平整度。

困难一点:在以上方法之后，通过测量然后使用脉冲、加热等退磁方法，人工或者自动校准局部或全部磁场，使之更加平整。

再困难一点:从磁场的制造源头开始优化，或者参考一些现在有的解决方法，比如可以用电磁铁或者超导体等，但是它们大部分都需要算法与软件和硬件，量产化之前较为昂贵。

再从安装方式开始:

简单的方法:使用硬胶或者软胶，一定的排列组合之后用笔在基座上画上线，然后直接把源粘在基座上面，经过以上的方法已经有一个较为平整的基准面，所以不用担心误差，物理与数学会原谅你。

困难一点:挑选更合适的连接方式或者胶水，经过一定设计的排列组合，使用镊子或者其他手段保证安装精度，并且可以使用普通的垫片在磁源下方进行微量调整以保证整体平行度。

再困难一点:筛选出最合适的连接方式，计算机模拟或者寻找现有最优排列方案，自动化以提升安装精度，使用复杂手段进行安装调优。

再然后是运动部件:

简单的方法:用塑料片或者其他什么东西保持滑块稳定。

困难一点:用某种能在网上查到的被动电路将滑块相对稳定在一个位置。

再困难一点:直接换成超导体，又或者用精密的控制以及算法加上电磁铁或者其他方式，让滑块稳定。

最后是调谐体:

简单一点:购买剪裁好的0.5c㎡或者你喜欢大小的调谐片，然后简单测量磁力或者仅凭结果反推出需要调整的地方，放上去进行调整，也可以使用胶水或者其他东西永久固定，这样从基准面到制造再到安装一套工序下来磁场本身就已经很平了，这个时候进行微量调节却还可以让它更平。

困难一点:第1层建议使用0.2mm厚度以上，使用定制的使用十字网格划分的36分区调谐片，将一块圆形磁铁划分为36个相等方形或者其他形状开口区域，有条件进行测量，将磁场较强的区域封闭，没条件直接安装，第2层使用较大直径有序或者无序排列的圆孔或者方孔网格调谐片，第3层使用较小直径有序或者无序排列的圆孔或者方孔网格调谐片，建议厚度层层递减。

再困难一点:使用计算机模拟后定制调谐片，或者直接使用调谐体，比如可以放上之后完美将磁场调节为超平面，又或者简单一点增加层数将磁场分层打碎为“流体”

这就结束了？不，最精彩的地方才刚刚开始！

可调整的部分结构:

一种经典结构:假设基座使用宽高比2:1的长方体木头，再使用一个比它更短比它更大的长方体木头中间挖出贯穿长方形口，使之可以套入基座四边间隙保持4mm左右充当滑块，基座上表面中心对称左右各安放一排磁铁，下表面同样，左表面中心线安放一排磁铁，右表面同样，然后在滑块上挖出空缺或者干脆只剩中空结构支撑用来安放长方形磁铁，总共总共6排长方形磁铁对应六排圆形磁铁。

伪钉扎效应:此结构特性，在加上物理支撑或者软件控制之后，限制了滑块上下左右旋转翻滚的自由度与超导体的钉扎效应极度相似，但是由于超导体的另一个效应导致可以在磁场表面前后移动，所以实际做到了功能基本相同。

可拼装的部分模块:

精度提升拼装:将以上经典结构视为一个模块，两个模块平行放置连接各自的滑块，然后可以继续提升数量来提升精度。

由于之前的原理验证，两个模块的精度高于一个，然后也可以继续一直增加数量提升精度直到收益某个极限。

大范围移动拼装:将两个模块按照精度提升拼装连接作为X轴，然后基座首尾两端放置在两个垂直于这两个模块的另外两个模块作为Y轴，最后按照这个方式在X轴上增加小型化模块作为Z轴。

由于之前的原理验证，这种架构最大程度上利用了所有组成架构的空间平均大幅度提升了精度表现，使得中心点的Z轴进入整个架构的“零点”。

小范围移动超精度拼装:将一个模块按照3×3点阵连接，使用8个模块来过滤误差使得中间模块最高精度得到质的飞跃。

可调整的部分模式:

全被动:在滑块表面使用物理支撑的方式使之稳定，或者在左边，右边、左右两边连接上另一个模块，被连接的模块连接上固定物品、移动物品等，在动力传导时一定程度上受限于固定物品，但是由于固定物品仅支撑翻滚与旋转自由度所以影响度小于20%，80%以上靠磁场与结构自稳定，由于模块本身就是滤波器，经过一个模块的过滤之后到中心模块又能被再过滤一次最大程度上减少影响，此模式本身静止需要外力推动。

半被动:使用某种有关电磁铁的电路特性可以在不需要算法的情况下使滑块维持稳定悬浮，此模式本身静止，可以增加控制装置人工调节推力。

半主动:使用某种东西主动提供推力以及控制推力。

全主动:使用某种方式主动提高推力以及控制推力，并且使用某种方式让滑块更加稳定并再次提升精度。

相位移动:固定滑块，使基座充当移动部件。

最后:多就是好，大就是强！

虽然可能单个模块就能达到无限精度，但是这需要付出极高的代价，所以应使用本身就是一种滤波器的结构来无限缩小这个代价。
